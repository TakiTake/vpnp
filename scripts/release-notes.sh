# Prints the CHANGELOG.md section for one version — the release notes that
# end up on the GitHub Release.
#
# Extracted so there is exactly one implementation, run by both of:
#   - `.github/workflows/release.yml`, to build the Release body
#   - the `/release` skill, as a preflight before the tag exists
# Them agreeing is the whole point: a heading this cannot find fails the
# release job *after* the tag is public, and a public tag cannot be
# pushed over.
#
# Usage: scripts/release-notes.sh <version> [changelog-path]
# Exits non-zero, with a message on stderr, when no section matches.

# The heading format is a contract, not a style choice, and this enforces
# all of it: `## [<version>] - YYYY-MM-DD`, matched from the start of the
# line. A prefix match alone would accept `## [1.2.3] -` with no date and
# `## [1.2.3] -nonsense`, publishing a release from a heading the format
# says is malformed. `## [1.2.3]` with no date, or extra leading space,
# matches nothing.
